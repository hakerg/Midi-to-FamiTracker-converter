# What it does?
It converts specified midi file to txt file, that can be imported to FamiTracker.

# How to use it?
First copy bass.dll and bassmidi.dll into executable directory.
```
./MidiToFamiTrackerConverter.exe <midi_file> [<txt_file>]
```
If txt_file is not specified, the output path will be the same as midi file but with changed extension.
